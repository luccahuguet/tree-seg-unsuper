# Cursor Rules for final-paper project

## Environment Setup
This project requires proper PATH environment configuration for command execution.

### Command Execution Fix
When running terminal commands, prefix with PATH export to ensure system commands are available:
```bash
export PATH="/bin:/usr/bin:$PATH" && your_command_here
```

### Common Issues
- Shell may not find basic commands like `bash`, `sed`, `id` without proper PATH
- Mise tool version manager warnings can be ignored
- Shell integration script warnings are cosmetic and don't affect functionality

### Project Structure
- Main project files in root directory
- Deployment configuration in `deployment/` folder
- Source code in `src/` directory
- Python 3.10.17 environment

### Best Practices
- Always export PATH before running commands
- Use absolute paths for critical system commands if needed
- Check Python version with: `export PATH="/bin:/usr/bin:$PATH" && python --version`
