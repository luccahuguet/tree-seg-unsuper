# TODO List - Tree Segmentation Project

- [x] small
- [x] large
- [x] giant (taking too long)
- [x] docs: parameter
- [x] docs: polish
- [x] fix docs comparison
- [x] fix notebook file, split output cells
- [ ] final check, read all the docs
- [x] recreate the outputs using stride 2
- [x] evaluate creating a page for stride 2, but probably not good, since we might instead want a page for v2
- [ ] fix elbow analysis bug - threshold line (0.15) doesn't intersect curve (ranges 6-2), scale/normalization issue
- dont use stride 8

## ðŸš€ Optional Future Enhancements
- [ ] Test different stride values for resolution vs performance trade-offs
- [ ] Experiment with different attention feature combinations
- [ ] Add validation metrics for segmentation quality
