# TODO

- [x] Verify v1/v2/v3/v4 separation; consider abandoning the version split if it no longer maps cleanly to the current pipelines. (Done: removed version gating; attention now explicit; version retained only as a label/supervised switch.)
- [ ] Schedule untried experiments from `experiments.md`:
  - [ ] Tile overlap optimization (128/384/512px)
  - [x] Potential k-means successors: spherical k-means (cosine), DP-means (auto-K), Potts-regularized k-means added to CLI
- [ ] Plan a larger sweep on FORTRESS (3–10 images) to identify the current peak performer across clustering/refine/tiling/stride variants.
- [ ] Add cache reuse for eval/segment: check metadata hash before running, return existing results/viz if found; support `--force/--no-cache`; skip cached configs in sweeps; handle partial artifacts (regen viz from labels).
- [ ] Future (optional): meta-learning on metadata bank
  - [ ] Add dataset feature descriptors (resolution stats, tile counts, class counts, color/entropy/exg)
  - [ ] Add a simple recommender:
    - [ ] Best historical configs for the dataset
    - [ ] Nearest dataset fallback if few runs
    - [ ] Optional LightGBM/RandomForest ranker to score configs; output top-K
  - [ ] (Optional later) BO/surrogate to propose next configs under runtime constraints
  - [ ] Expose via `tree-seg results --recommend --dataset <name>`
- [ ] Codebase hygiene:
  - [ ] Scan for large files/duplication; centralize shared clustering logic (k-means variants) to reduce copy/paste.
  - [ ] Split monoliths (`core/segmentation.py`) into smaller modules for readability/testing.
  - [ ] Split CLIs (`tree_seg/cli/evaluate.py`, `tree_seg/cli/segment.py`) into config builders, runners, and output/reporting helpers.
  - [ ] Refactor evaluation/benchmark plumbing (`tree_seg/evaluation/benchmark.py`, `tree_seg/api.py`) to share data loading, segmentation calls, and metrics aggregation.
  - [ ] Break plotting into focused modules (`tree_seg/visualization/plotting.py`) for composites, metrics charts, and panel layouts.
  - [ ] Continue slimming DINO adapter: move registry/config to `registry.py` and forward/reshape helpers to `features.py`.
  - [ ] Extract k-selection/PCA/metrics assembly from `core/segmentation.py` into dedicated helpers.
  - [ ] Move to latest supported Python runtime when feasible.
- [ ] Docs: update stale site content to reflect current CLI, metadata/results features, and removed version split.
