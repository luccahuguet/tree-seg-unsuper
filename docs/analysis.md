# Analysis

## Performance Evaluation

### Algorithmic Performance

Our DINOv2-based approach demonstrates several key strengths:

#### 1. Feature Quality
- **Rich Representations**: 768-dimensional feature space captures fine-grained tree characteristics
- **Self-Supervised Learning**: No manual annotation requirements
- **Scale Invariance**: Robust across different tree sizes and densities

#### 2. Clustering Effectiveness
- **Automatic K-Selection**: Elbow method with 0.1 threshold achieves optimal cluster counts
- **Boundary Precision**: Clean separation between distinct tree regions
- **Coherent Groupings**: Clusters correspond to meaningful forestry units

#### 3. Computational Efficiency
- **Processing Speed**: ~45 seconds per high-resolution image
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient handling of large aerial imagery
- **Scalability**: Batch processing capabilities for multiple images

### Qualitative Assessment

#### Strengths
1. **Boundary Accuracy**: Precise delineation of tree canopy edges
2. **Region Coherence**: Meaningful clustering of similar vegetation
3. **Visual Quality**: Professional visualization outputs
4. **Parameter Sensitivity**: Robust across different elbow thresholds

#### Areas for Improvement
1. **Dense Canopy Handling**: Some over-segmentation in very dense areas
2. **Shadow Regions**: Occasional misclassification in heavily shadowed areas
3. **Edge Cases**: Performance varies with extreme lighting conditions

### Model Size Impact on Segmentation

Our systematic comparison across DINOv2 model sizes reveals important insights:

#### K-Selection Patterns
- **Small Model (384D)**: Optimal K=4 clusters
- **Base Model (768D)**: Optimal K=5 clusters  
- **Large Model (1024D)**: Optimal K=5 clusters
- **Giant Model (1536D)**: Optimal K=6 clusters

This progression demonstrates how higher-dimensional feature representations enable detection of more granular tree region distinctions.

#### Boundary Quality Assessment
Visual inspection of edge overlay results shows:
- **Improved precision** with larger models
- **Better separation** of similar vegetation types
- **Diminishing returns** beyond Base model for most applications
